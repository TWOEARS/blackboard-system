classdef SegmentationHypothesis < Hypothesis
    % SEGMENTATIONHYPOTHESIS This class represents the segmentation results
    %   that have been generated by SegmentationKS for one particular sound
    %   source. The hypothesis will be represented as a "soft-mask", which
    %   is generated by performing clustering on the segmentation results.
